 location is fine.
Type: string
Default:

Template: mlat-client/receiver-lon
Description: Longitude of receiver, in decimal degrees:

Template: mlat-client/receiver-alt
Description: Altitude of receiver, in metres (height above ellipsoid):
 The multilateration server must know the location of the receiver. This should
 be the position of the antenna, ideally to within about 25m. A GPS-derived altitude is
 fine. This value should be in metres.
Type: string
Default:

Template: mlat-client/input-type
Description: Receiver type: 
 This setting sets the type of receiver that Mode S messages will
 be read from.
 .
 dump1090:
  dump1090 (MalcolmRobb or mutability fork), or anything else
  that can generate Beast-format messages with a 12MHz clock.
 beast: 
  The Mode-S Beast.
 radarcape_gps: 
  Radarcape with GPS timestamps (preferred).
 radarcape_12mhz:
  Radarcape with legacy 12MHz timestamps.
 sbs:
  Kinetic Avionics SBS-1/SBS-3 systems.

Choices: dump1090, beast, radarcape_gps, radarcape_12mhz, sbs
Default: dump1090

Template: mlat-client/input-host
Description: Input host for Mode S traffic:
 The multilateration client needs to read Mode S messages from a
 receiver such as dump1090. Here you can configure the host that the receiver
 is running on.
Type: string
Default: localhost

Template: mlat-client/input-port
Description: Input port for Mode S traffic:
 The multilateration client needs to read Mode S messages from a
 receiver such as dump1090. Here you can configure the port that the receiver
 is listening on.
 .
 For dump1090, you need Beast-format output. This is usually available on port 30005.
 For Radarcapes, use port 10002.
 For SBS, use port 30006.
Type: string
Default: 30005

Template: mlat-client/output-host

 This is to be used with the output-host option. Input the connection port of the alternate server.
Type: string
Default:
 
Template: mlat-client/sbs-port

 This setting controls the port mlat-client will listen on for these connections.
Type: string
Default: 31003

Template: mlat-client/sbs-ext-port
Description: Port for extended-SBS-format output connections (0 disables):
 The multilateration client can return the calculated aircraft positions in an extended version
 of the Basestation format. This extended version include the number of stations used to find
 the position, and the geometric dilution of precision. Usually only interesting if you arew
 processing the data yourself (standard clients will not understand the extended format).
Type: string
Default: 0
